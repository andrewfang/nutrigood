Limitations
===
This app was built with a special focus on user interface
design and development. Therefore, it is not connected to any
backend service, and the data is largely made up. Food will
not actually be delivered, and recommendations are purely
randomized in nature. Configuring the profile will not change
the recommended nutritional intake.
Furthermore, the watch component is merely a proof of concept.
No actual biometric information is synced, and no changes are
made to the nutritional needs of the user.
